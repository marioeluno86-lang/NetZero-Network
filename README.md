# NetZero Network

A blockchain-powered platform for transparent carbon credit tracking and trading, enabling individuals and businesses to offset emissions verifiably while incentivizing sustainable practices — all on-chain.

## Overview

NetZero Network consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and verifiable ecosystem for carbon credit management:

1. **Carbon Credit Token Contract** – Issues and manages verifiable carbon credits as tokens.
2. **Project Verification Contract** – Handles registration and milestone verification for carbon offset projects.
3. **Marketplace Contract** – Facilitates buying, selling, and retiring of carbon credits.
4. **Governance DAO Contract** – Enables token holders to vote on platform upgrades and project approvals.
